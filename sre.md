SRE stands for Site Reliability Engineering
Flexible working hours
Their culture is based on learning and participation
There are no bureaucratic approvals or historic leftovers
They like to have fun.
They never say “this is not my job”
They never start new feature if a bug is not fixed
They are accountable, responsible
They believe that the root cause of incidents is primarily the lack of Code Review before merging code into the master.
They establish conventions (code linting, branching models ) before starting.
They try to automate the validation of these conventions by translating them to quality gates in the CI/CD pipelines.
Everyone tries to not be a single point of failure by following conventions and setting up CI/CD from day zero for any new codebase.
They love containers
They build container images from the least sized image like alpine or slim
They play ping-pong 😁
